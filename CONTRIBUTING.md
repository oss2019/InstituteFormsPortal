# Contributing to InstituteFormsPortal

Contributions are what makes the open-source community such an amazing place to
learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly
appreciated**.

There are many ways in which you can contribute to this repository which can be breadly split into two major parts
1. Non-Code Part: This includes updating the [README.md](https://github.com/oss2019/InstituteFormsPortal/blob/main/README.md), documenting the code, providing with Feature Request and many more if you are not good at coding stuff up.
2. Coding Part: This includes directly interacting with the code and solving [Issues](https://github.com/oss2019/InstituteFormsPortal/issues).

## Finding what to do
- If you are new to the project then the issues labelled with the [**Good First Issue**](https://github.com/oss2019/InstituteFormsPortal/labels/good%20first%20issue) label are the right place for you to start with. These will help you understand the codebase by implementing small features.

- If you are an experienced devloper than you can go to the [**Issues**](https://github.com/oss2019/InstituteFormsPortal/issues) and start picking up the issues that you like.

- Some general guidelines to keep in mind while picking up the issues are the following
  - Do not start coding up stuff by yourself. The PRs which are associated with an issue are much more likely to be accepted than PRs not associated with any issue.
  - Make sure to check if there is already any PR that is associated with the issue that you want to work on in the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/oss2019/InstituteFormsPortal/pulls) section. Some issues might not have been closed even after the PRs have been merged make sure to check if the PRs are merged or not of the issue you want to work on.

## What after choosing an Issue to work on?
You need to comment on the issue that you are up to take that issue and wait till the repository mantainer to assign you with the issue. You can use the 
[Interested To Work](/#) template to comment on the issue you are intrested to work on.

Once the mantainer assignes you with the task then you can start working on it. Make sure to adhere to the [JS Best Practices](https://code.tutsplus.com/24-javascript-best-practices-for-beginners--net-5399t) in order to mantain uniformity in the code. PRs in which code does not adhere to the best practices might not be merged.

## How to submit a PR
Once you are done writing the code then you can proceed to sumit the PR. You will be prompted to fill up a `Pull Request Template` inorder for the mantainer to know what all is there in the PR.
